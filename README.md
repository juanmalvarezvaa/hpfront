# Prosigliere Harry Potter

Done by Juan Manuel Alvarez.

## Overview

This is a demo Frontend about Harry Potter. Done with React, TS, Vite, pure CSS and Material UI for some components.

This is just a small demo. I wanted to keep it under the requested time and not extend and add a lot of possible functionalities and improvements. To name a few: Better UI/UX, improve responsivness, add better error handling and improve performance, etc. A LOT could be added but IMO, it would take me more time and I understood that was not the idea of the test.

I hope you like it!
